            <h3>DOKKAEBI:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p>We have been working on her for a quite some time. We had already explored various ideas and even approved some changes that were scheduled to begin production during Y7. However, due to other pressing priorities, her progress was consistently delayed. The purpose of this prototype was to prevent the current situation to happen. We intended to limit her initial strength while enhancing her potential by the end of the round, allowing for a snowball effect if played strategically. Unfortunately, given the current circumstances, this proposal isn't ideal anymore. Consequently, we've decided to focus on a more substantial change - one that addresses most of the existing issues and frustrations - for a future patch.</p></li>
                <li><p>In the meantime, we believe that a small adjustment to her resource management could alleviate some of the frustration when playing against her and the ban rate. Specifically, preventing Dokkaebi from calling defenders immediately after spawning should help improve the overall perception.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>NØKK:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p>As we previously mentioned, we have been actively exploring various ideas to enhance Nøkk's play style. After careful consideration, we decided to move away from the 'silent' approach. Our belief is that sound plays a pivotal role in Siege, and everyone should be able to rely on it consistently. Additionally, being silent tends to encourage to try luck sneaking up on opponents for surprise eliminations, which can be frustrating for the victim and not a very tactical approach.</p></li>
                <li><p>Therefore, we made the decision to enhance Nøkk's capabilities related to fake intel by reducing reliance on defensive intel tools. Now the ability gauge will only deplete when Nøkk performs an action that causes her glitch. This adjustment allows her to hold angles indefinitely without being detected, creating a deceptive sense of security for defenders as they navigate around the map. Instead of solely relying on going into the bomb site to take down targets, Nøkk will excel at cutting rotations and flank watching. This change will also allow Nøkk to push along a teammate without being worried about the ability running out, so will be easier take the defender by surprise if it was expecting a 1v1 situation.</p></li>
                <li><p>We've also adjusted the ability values. On one hand, we've reduced the maximum resources because it now represents the time Nøkk can glitch with the ability active. The ability can be active throughout the entire round if she manages not to glitch. On the other hand, we've extended the time needed to refill the ability, making reckless consumption without good reason more punishing.</p></li>
                <li><p>While this change will impact all defensive cameras, Valkyrie is likely to be the most affected defender. This isn't due to the cameras being weaker, but rather because they now face another effective counter. Avoiding Evil Eyes and Bulletproof Cameras is relatively straightforward since they are easy to spot. However, Black Eyes are more challenging to avoid because their locations are often unknown, and it's likely that you will still be within their range when the ability expires.</p></li>

            <h3>PROXIMITY ALARM:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p>We've noticed an increase in player feedback concerning Sentry and the potent combination of the Nitro Cell with the Proximity Alarm, especially when players depend solely on the Proximity Alarm Scoring System to activate their pre-placed Nitro Cell from any location on the map.</p></li>
                <li><p>Our data analysis indicates that this tactic is not the most frequently chosen combination. Nonetheless, we recognize the potential frustration it can cause. Therefore, we have opted to remove the score given when an enemy triggers a Proximity Alarm. While Sentry can still utilize the sound cue to set off pre-placed Nitro Cells close to Proximity Alarms, the absence of scoring means he must depend solely on sound, which we consider to be a more fair interaction.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>R4-C:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Our intention when reducing the R4-C magazine size is to balance Ash's overall effectiveness and the number of gunfights she can engage in before needing to reload. A smaller magazine encourages more thoughtful ammo management, reduces sustained firepower, and limits the angles she can pre-fire. R4-C users will need to be more precise with their shots.</p></li>
                <li><p>Additionally, this change distinguishes the R4-C from other options available---the G36C on Ash or the LMG-E on Ram---encouraging players to re-evaluate the advantages of each weapon and choose the one that best suits their needs.</p></li>
